		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<p>The main focus of this lab was to create local file structures onto my computer and add index.html files. Doing this helps us better understand how to structure our files and to oevrall help us become more organized.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Creating the different file structures was a bit confusing at first. Also, when I was creating the home page index.html file, I was having a lot of trouble trying to get my pictures to show up on my browser. I figured out that it was because I didn't type in the entire code. I didn't type in the entire code that was given to me because I was a bit confused on if they were only refrencing screenshots or images that were already downloaded on my computer. Now, I realize what I was thinking before did not make any sense. I was also confused as to why we had to "id" our images, but I realized that it makes it easer for us to edit our photos with the corresponding CSS files. Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this project and I am really happy that i am learning so much.</p>
