    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>I kept getting the CORS error, despite me having downloading the CORS error extension and neither Ashley or I were able to figure out how to fix this. It was able to work on her end, but we don't know if it is because she has a windows computer and I have a MacBook. I also tried adding in some code that was supposed to be able to "force" the browser to allow CORS, which was: var cors = require('cors')/app.use(cors()). And I think with that, we were getting really close, but the console kept saying "required is undefined at line ___", so that also stumped us really good.</p>
