    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>This lab was challenging for me in the sense that I barley had about 20 hours of sleep since friday 11/12 until now 11/22, so it made things difficult to follow along. I also tried to refrence Wes's lab, however their example made things a bit more complicated for me because they had a bunch of extra stuff included in their code, where as I just wanted the simplest example in order to get my own lab finished so I can finally sleep. I am very grateful that I have Ashley as a partner who was able to help me finish this lab, despite me being very brain dead while I was completing this lab.</p>

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>Some problems I faced was I forgot to put some symbols in, and at first my lab kept printing out exclamation points. Then, it printed almost correctly, but I did not add any breaks so the string printed out in one continuous line. Finally, we were able to solve this problem by just simply adding breaks and the script output printed propperly.</p>
