		<h1>Lab 4: Psudeocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to practice thinking about pseudocoding, which is basically just creating an outline before jumping straight into the actual code.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>For our psudeocodes, Ashley and I chose to do explain how to bake a vanilla cake and for our computer to preform the game "minesweeper". One of the main challenges we faced was trying to come up with a way to figure out how we would "command" the computer to preform an action. We were also confused on what the purpose of the author block is, however I think we were able to overcome that challenge.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>We didn't really come accross any problems, we were able to figure things out by working together and bouncing ideas off each other. We were able to overcome the different challenges we faced, and I feel like we picked a fairly easy "task" for us to psudeocode.</p>

		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>Here are the psudeocodes ashley and I created together:</P>
			<p>Vanilla cake</p>
			<ol type="1">
			<li>Gather baking equiptment:</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Cake mold</li>
				<li>Parchment Paper</li>
				<li>Mixer</li>
				<li>Mixing Bowls</li>
				<li>Measuring spoons and cups</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Gather baking materials:<li>
				<ol type= "a">
				<li>Cooking spray</li>
				<li>2 ⅔ cups of all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon of baking powder</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
				<li>Salt</li>
				<li>3 eggs</li>
				<li>¾ cups of milk</li>
				<li>¾ cups of vegetable oil</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350℉.</li>
			<li>Spray the cake mold and line it with the parchment paper</li>
			<li>Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract and salt in a bowl</li>
			<li>To the same bowl, add the eggs, milk and vegetable oil</li>
			<li>Mix until smooth</li>
			<li>Pour the cake batter into the cake mold</li>
			<li>Bake the cake until a toothpick can be inserted into the center and come out without any residue. (Usually about 1 hour)</li>
			<li>Take out the cake and let it cool for 15-30 minuets</li>
			<li>Consume</li>
		</ol>

			<p>Minesweeper</P>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Print minesweeper board</li>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Randomly generate bombs with each new map</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Accept user input</li>
					<li>Check if selected block has a bomb or not</li>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>If there is a bomb, the game resets</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Clear out blocks based on input location</li>
					<li>Calculate how many bombs are within each block’s 3x3 vicinity and print on designated block</li>
					<li>If the remaining blocks are all bomb spaces, then the player wins and the game resets</li>
				</ol>

			<p>Minesweeper Psudeocode Turned to Comments</p>
			<pre><code>
				// Print minesweeper board
				  // Randomly generate bombs with each new map
				// Accept user input
