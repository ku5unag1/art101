		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to learn how to write functions and be able to manipulate strings.</P>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was a bit hard for me to understand at first, but Ashley helped me understand how to create functions for this lab. She also helped me figure out if these functions worked by showing me how to use the Google Chrome Console. I was able to understand the lab with her help and she was able to reassure me by checking my code and making sure things were typed properly.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>The biggest problem I am facing right now and with the previous lab was that my files were not able to be uploaded to my GitHub website. I was even in office hours with my TA, Pete, trying to debug the situation to try and get my site to publish. However, after over an hour, we were unable to come up with a solution. I will update as soon as I am able to figure it out, or get some help with getting my site to publish.</p>
