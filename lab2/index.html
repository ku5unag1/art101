		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>Hello, I'm Ashley Lu. I'm a 3rd year AGPM (game art and design) major at UCSC. I've taken a couple of introductory Python courses and I have some experience with JavaScript. In my free time, I like to draw and play games. I have 2 chihuahuas back at home.</p>
		<p>Hello, my name is Nkem Ndidi. I am a 5th year art major. I am 22 years old, and I am currently a student at UCSC. I do not have much experience with coding, which is why I am taking this class. I feel like this skill would help me improve my art career so I can build my own online portfolio for potential clients and employers.</p>
