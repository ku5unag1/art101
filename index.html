		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<center><img id="my-portrait" src="img/selfie.jpeg"/></center>
		<p>My name is Nkem Ndidi.
			 I am a 5th year art major and I attend the University of California, Santa Cruz. I have a grey cat named Nori, and he is two years old. My favorite activities include drawing, painting, watching cartoons and playing video games with my friends. I have been a self taught artist my entire life leading up to my enrollment at UCSC. My goal is to work for an animation company such as DreamWorks, Nickelodeon, or Disney and to one day own my own animation studio. For now, however, I am working on becoming an art teacher for High School or Middle School children.</p>
