    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had trouble figuring out where I should get the api or what an endpoint was. It turned out to be simple, in the end. Just type in something then add api, on a google search. For example, pokemon api (though we looked at that one and it looked really complicated). Then it came to our attention that we needed to use an api that had "https" and not "http". Surprisingly, that took a bit of time to find. However, we ended up using a random quote generator.</p>

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>Some of the problems we faced was that with the first couple of api's we used, we couldn't get it to work and we didn't know why it wasn't working. We tried about 4 different api's until we got to the random quote generator and it worked! However, I ended up making a couple mistakes in my code, such as placing the variable in the wrong area or not using consistant words so that the function would know what it's calling.</p>
