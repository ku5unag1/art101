		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>So this project was not hard at all, however I did run into a really big problem this weekend which was my laptop completely dying on me making it really had to complete this project. I was able to make it through this project because I had a back up laptop, and thankfully I had everything saved on to GitHub so I did not have to do everything all over again. That was pretty much it for the challenges I faced.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I did not really face any problems, aside from my laptop dying (see "Challenges"). Due to my laptop dying, I had to zoom through this lab. But I think I did okay.</p>
