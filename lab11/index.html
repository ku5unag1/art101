    <h1>Lab 11: Libraries and jQuery</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with Libraries and jQuery in JavaScript.</p>

  <div id="challenge" class="sectionbox">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Some of the challenges I had to overcome was actually understanding how to use jQuery because I missed lecture on Thursday. However, after refrencing Wes's code and w3schools, I was able to figure out how to use jQuery. If you click on the "challenge" button, you get a little positive affirmation :)</p>

  <div id="problem" class="sectionbox">
    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>I had a tough time figuring out how to get this button, specifically, to work. Also, whenever I made a mistake on my JS files, all of my buttons disappered. Through a lot of trial and error, and a lot of using the "inspect" tool on Google Chrome, Ashley and I were able to figure it out.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="results" class="sectionbox">
    <h4>Results</h4>
    <p>The results of my lab was that when you click on the "challenge" button, you get an alert, and when you click "ok", the background turns green. When you click on the "problems" button, the background turns green, and when you double click on the "results" button, the background turns green and the text disappears!</p>
