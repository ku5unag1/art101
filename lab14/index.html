    <p>Since Ashley and I worked pretty hard on our labs, we got them all to work so there weren't any labs for me to revisit so I could work on them. I just ended up chaning minor things here and there.</p>

    <p>All I really did was fix the title in the heading of my HTML file for lab 13. I had the title say Lab 10 instead of lab 13. Since it doesn't really show up when I test the files locally, I am just showing a before and after photo.</p>
