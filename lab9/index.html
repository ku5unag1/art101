    <p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with DOM elements.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>This lab gave me a bit of difficulties just becasue I had  really hard time understanding how to do the lab, even when going back and rewatching the lectures.</p>

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>As I had said for challenges, this lab was a bit difficult to understand, even when I was following along with the lecure videos, however after Wes uploaded thier solution to the lab on Slack, it made things easier to understand because I could see their comments and then the actual code underneath and I could figure out what the steps in the lab wanted me to do. I also had some trouble trying to put a border around my script output. However, I was able to figure it out becasue before I would use numbers to determine the width (ex. 50px) and it wouldn't work, however, when I'd use words like "thin" "thick", or "medium", it would.</p>
