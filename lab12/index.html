    <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had a hard time figuring out how to do this lab, so as usual I decided to look for Wes's code for help. My text output would keep saying 'This is your type!Undefinedundefined'. Ashley helped me a lot by suggesting that I should reformat the way I was typing things because I originally had but Title:/Text:.
    Ashley was saying that since I am not calling an array anymore, I could just use "title:text".

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>The problems I ran into was that the original code I was using wouldn't work when I was trying to use the Title:/Text:. My code kept saying that there was an undefined line at a certain line, or something was not a function (but that was due to my own stupidity because I don't know how to spell). I also am very sleep deprived and did not get any sleep at all the night before so my brain was really scrambled doing this project. In the end and with Ashley's help, however, I was able to overcome these obstacles and I get a fun little Pokemon Type Matchup to play with on my browser!
