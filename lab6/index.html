		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to learn how to use JavaScript to declare arrays and objects on the Google Chrome console.</p>
	</div>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was kind of intimidating becasue due to my previous technical issues, I was having a hard time trying to understand how to do the lab. However, after reviewing the lecture videos, I was able to figure out how to declare the arrays and objects.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>The only problem that had occured for me was that I was getting syntax errors when I was trying to declare the variable for myMainRide. I was able to fix that, however. Another problem I ran into was that I was not able to get my lists to show when I was trying to use the console.log command. It turns out that I kept putting the "+" when I did not need to, which was why my code was acting that way and not showing the onjects I declared.</p>
